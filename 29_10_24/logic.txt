Question:Replace 0 and 1 in a Number.

Input: The program asks the user for the length of the number and then the number itself. It could take any number from 0 to 1 .
output:The 0s and 1s are replaced by 1s and 0s respectively and the other digits remains the same.
  

It iterates through all the characters altering the required ones. 

Example:
Enter the length of the number: 5
Enter a number: 10101
Modified number is: 01010

NOTE:The program would scan more numbers than the length but it would only replace the 0s and 1s till the length provided by the user .
     Hence the output would contain unaltered 0s and 1s after the length entered by the user.
